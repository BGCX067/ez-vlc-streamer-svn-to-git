#EZ vlc streamer 0.10#
######################

In later versions of VLC, the functionality to stream multiple files has been removed. This script allows you to use that functionality again.

Currently, EZ vlc streamer only allows streaming over HTTP. However, we are currently working to get other protocols up and running.

HOW TO USE
1. Open a terminal window
2. type "sh /path/to/streamer/EZvlcstreamer.sh" without the quotes
3. drag the files you would like to stream into the terminal window and press enter.
4. Add the addresses you would like to stream to and press enter.  If you want to stream to any device, leave this blank or enter 0.0.0.0
5. Now, add the port you would like your stream to use and hit enter.  In most cases, this would be 8080, but it can be any number you want!
6. The next question will start the stream as soon as you press enter
7. In the computer that you are streaming to, tell VLC to open a stream using HTTP on your.ip.address.here:port
8. In many cases, you might want to reorder the files to be streamed in the queue, but that's all up to you!
9. Enjoy your media!

Thank you for using EZ Vlc Streamer!
